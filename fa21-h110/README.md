### Notes

#### Quadratic Forms

###### Ellipse
- Defined as set of points with the same sum of distance to two points (the foci)
- *(x/α)<sup>2</sup> + (y/β)<sup>2</sup> = 1*
- *α*, *β* refers to semi-major and semi-minor axes respectively
- Can prove geometrically that foci are at *(±f, 0)* where *f<sup>2</sup> = α<sup>2</sup> - β<sup>2</sup>
- A light ray generated from one focus reflects at the boundary to end up at the other focus 

###### Parabola
- Defined as set of points of equal distance from a point (the focus) and a line (the directrix)
- *y = kx<sup>2</sup>*
- Can prove geometrically that the focus is *(0, f)* where *f = 1/4k* and the line is *y = -f*
- A light ray perpendicular to the directrix, reflected off the concave portion of the parabola will hit the focus

###### Hyperbola
- Defined as set of points with the same difference of distance to two points (the foci)
- *(x/α)<sup>2</sup> - (y/β)<sup>2</sup> = 1*
- Can prove geometrically that the foci are *(±f, 0)* where *f<sup>2</sup> = α<sup>2</sup> + β<sup>2</sup>
- A light ray emitted from one foci and reflected off the hyperbola is congruent to a light ray emitted from the other foci to the point of reflection
- Equivalently, the tangent of the hyperbola at that point bisects the angle formed with the two foci

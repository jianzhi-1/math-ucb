### Notes

#### Catalan Numbers

#### Generating Functions

#### Recurrence Relations

#### Modular Arithmetics
- Order
- *v<sub>p</sub>(n)*

### Chebyshev Polynomials
- *T<sub>n</sub>(cos x) = cos(nx)*
- *T<sub>n+1</sub> = 2xT<sub>n</sub> - T<sub>n-1</sub>*
- *deg(T<sub>n</sub>) = n - 1*
- Leading coefficient of *T<sub>n</sub> = 2<sup>n - 1</sup>*

### Dirichlet Kernel

### Circulent Matrix
### Hankel Matrix

### Fields
A field is a set with several structures and two operations, denoted as +, *.

### Topology in ℂ
- \[Open disk] The open disk of radius *r > 0* about *z<sub>0</sub>* is given by *B<sub>r</sub>(z<sub>0</sub>) = {z ∈ ℂ | |z - z<sub>0</sub> < r}*
- \[Open] Say *Ω ⊂ ℂ* is **open** if for every *z ∈ Ω*, *∃r > 0* s.t. *B<sub>r</sub>(z) ⊂ Ω*.
- \[Closed] Say *Ω ⊂ ℂ* is **closed** if *Ω<sup>c</sup>* is open.
- \[Boundary] Define the **boundary** of *Ω ⊂ ℂ* as *∂Ω = {z ∈ ℂ | B<sub>r</sub>(z) ∩ Ω ≠ Ø, B<sub>r</sub>(z) ∩ Ω<sup>c</sup> ≠ Ø}*
- \[Closure] Define the **closure** of *Ω ⊂ ℂ* as *Ω ∪ ∂Ω*.
- \[Bounded] Say *Ω ⊂ ℂ* is **bounded** if *∃M > 0* s.t. *Ω ⊂ B<sub>M</sub>(0)*.
- \[Compact] Say *Ω ⊂ ℂ* is **compact** if *Ω* is closed and bounded.
- \[Connected] Say *Ω ⊂ ℂ* is **connected** if *∃* two disjoint **open** sets *A, B* s.t. *Ω ⊂ A∪B* but *Ω ⊄ A* and *Ω ⊄ B*.
- \[Region] Say *Ω ⊂ ℂ* is a **region** if *Ω* is open and connected.
- \[Complete] A metric space *(S, d)* is **complete** if every Cauchy sequence converges.

##### Theorems and Lemmas
- Let *Ω ⊂ ℂ*. Then the following are equivalent:
  - *Ω* is closed
  - For any sequence *(z<sub>n</sub>) ∈ Ω*, if *(z<sub>n</sub>) → z)*, then *z ∈ Ω* (i.e. *Ω* contains all limit points)
  - *∂Ω ⊂ Ω*
  - *Ω* is equal to its own closure
- The complex plane ℂ is complete.
- Every compact metric space is complete (i.e. every Cauchy sequence has to converge).

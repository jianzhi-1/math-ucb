- [x] Week 0: Proofs, Real numbers (lec1)
- [x] Week 1: Completeness Axiom, max, min, sup, inf (lec2)

### Notes
- Completeness Axiom for reals: Any **nonempty** subset of R that is bounded above (i.e. admits at least 1 upper bound) admits suprenum (as a real).
- Archimedean property: For any *a*, *b* *>0*, exists a natural number n s.t. *na > b*.
- Denseness of Q: for every *a < b*, exists a rational *r* s.t. *a < r < b*.

#### Monotone Sequences and Cauchy Sequences
- All *monotone* sequences converge (to a real number for bounded sequences) or diverges to +- inf.
- *lim sup s<sub>n</sub> = lim sup{s<sub>n</sub>: n > N}*
